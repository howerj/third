# third

This is a de-obfuscated version of the language(s) first/third, a
[FORTH][] like computing language made by an entrant *buzzard* to the
[IOCCC][]. I have made a few minimal changes to make things a little
simpler to understand and more efficient as well.

Type:

	make

To build the system and:

	make run

To run the interpreter with a minimal set of words.
