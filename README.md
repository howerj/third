## THIRD

This is a de-obfuscated version of the language(s) first/third, a
[FORTH][] like computing language made by an entrant *buzzard* to the
[IOCCC][]. I have made a few minimal changes to make things a little
simpler to understand and more efficient as well.

The original files are in a folder called *original/*. Simply type **make** to get
things working, this will compile the program and run it. Type **make help** to
get a list of all the options available.

### TODO

* Error testing.
* Make files as small as possible.
* Continue de-obfuscation.
* Improve efficiency of the search function.
* Rewrite certain functions? scanf, atoi, etc?
